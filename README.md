# ML.NET API reference documentation

This repo contains documentation for the ML.NET API Reference. The ML.NET API Reference is auto-generated from the source code /// comments, so documentation changes should be made at the [dotnet/machinelearning](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning) repo.
